We have to perform several tests (same with PSO and GA)

1. run the optimization algorithm with Constants.U1, get gamma1
2. run the optimization algorithm with Constants.U2, get gamma2
3. run the optimization algorithm with Constants.U3, get gamma3

make a graphic with the system running on (u1,gamma1), then (u2,gamma2), then (u3, gamma3)
display: u, gamma, throughput
